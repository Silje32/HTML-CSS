    <h1>HOW TO CREATE A WEBPAGE</h1>
    <p>To create a webpage you need to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
      Make a root folder on your computer. Then open your root folder in a code
      editor. VS code is recommended.
    </p>
    <main>
      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>HTML is the building blocks of webpages.</p>
      <p>
        To start a new project you need an index.html file. In this file you
        will write all of your html code. Every index.html file also need a
        title.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML elements</h3>
      <p>
        To make something an element you need an opening tag and a closing tag.
        Between the two tags is the element itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you write code always write the opening tag and closing tag first.
        Then write the content in between.
      </p>
      <h3>4 really useful tags</h3>
      <h4>Header</h4>
      <p>
        Inside here you write the websites title and you put the logo and
        navigation.
      </p>
      <h4>Section</h4>
      <p>Stand alone sections of content.</p>
      <h4>Footer</h4>
      <p>Here you can write copyright and terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>And anything you are used to see at the bottom of the page.</p>
      <h4>Main</h4>
      <p>Here you write the main content of the page.</p>
      <p>A main tag may hold several section tags.</p>

      <h3>2 self closing tags</h3>
      <h4>Img</h4>
      <h4>Input</h4>

      <img href="Various_input_types1" alt="input examples" />

      <p>You only need one h1 per webpage.</p>
      <p>
        Your headings tell you the structure of your page. DonÂ´t use headings
        for font sizes. You can do that with CSS.
      </p>

      <h5>Paragraph text</h5>
      <p>
        Usually after a heading you will find some paragraph text and the p
        element is used for that.
      </p>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS is what makes websites look cool.</p>

      <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
      <p>JavaScript adds interactivity to your webpages.</p>
