    <h1>HOW TO CREATE A WEBPAGE.</h1>
    <p>To create a webpage you need to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
      Make a root folder on your computer. Then open your root folder in a code
      editor. VS code is recommended.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML is the building blocks of webpages.</p>
    <p>
      To start a new project you need an index.html file. In this file you will
      write all of your html code. Every index.html file also need a title.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML elements</h3>
    <p>
      To make something an element you need an opening tag and a closing tag.
      Between the two tags is the element itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you write code always write the opening tag and closing tag first.
      Then write the content in between.
    </p>
    <h4>100 elements to choose from</h4>
    <h5>Heading h1 to heading h6</h5>
    <p>You only need one h1 per webpage.</p>
    <p>
      Your headings tell you the structure of your page. DonÂ´t use headings for
      font sizes. You can do that with CSS.
    </p>

    <h5>Paragraph text</h5>
    <p>
      Usually after a heading you will find some paragraph text and the p
      element is used for that.
    </p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS is what makes websites look cool.</p>

    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <p>JavaScript adds interactivity to your webpages.</p>
